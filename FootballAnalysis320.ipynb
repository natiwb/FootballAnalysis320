    "First and foremost, we will be establishing what we believe to be the most important boundary for this project, we will be referring to the sport exclusively as football not soccer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will be using was compiled by Mart Jürisoo and is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017?resource=download.\n",

    "## Factors to be considered:\n",
    "### Time period\n",
    "This dataset has all the results of international football fixtures from 1872 to 2022. While it would be amazing to consider the data from 1872, we also thought of the possibility that it would be rather unfair on most countries that were colonized at the time and hence did not have a national team to compete with. Thus we will be limiting the data to 1976 to 2022 "
