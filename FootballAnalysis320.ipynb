    "# CMSC 320 FINAL PROJECT: WHAT COUNTRY HAS HAD THE GREATEST NATIONAL FOOTBALL(SOCCER) TEAM IN THE LAST 22 YEARS?\n",
    "Owners: Nathaniel Bekele and Mikias Atnafu\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "First and foremost, we will be establishing what we believe to be the most important boundary for this project, we will be referring to the sport exclusively as football not soccer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will be using was compiled by Mart JÃ¼risoo and is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017?resource=download.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factors to be considered:\n",
    "### Time period\n",
    "This dataset has all the results of international football fixtures from 1872 to 2022. While it would be amazing to consider the data from 1872, we also thought of the possibility that it would be rather unfair on most countries that were colonized at the time and hence did not have a national team to compete with. We also wanted to limit the data from 2000 onwards so that we can find the greatest national team in this current millenium. Thus we will be only be considering data from 2000 to 2022 "

    "Before we start analysing who is the greatest national football team, we need to preprocess the data. So, let us first read the csv file into a panda dataframe. We have used two data sets for this project, The first one is the international football results which has general football result data from the 1870s, and the second one is the football world cup summary, which will has world cup data showing who reached the final and who won the world cup over the years starting from 1930.
